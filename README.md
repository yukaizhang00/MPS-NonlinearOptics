# MPS-NonlinearOptics
Applying matrix product state to nonlinear optics.
The kernel of this project for now is `MPS_MPO.py` file, it is the python file contains all the functions for MPS (e.g. translate a general state to MPS, translate a general operator to MPO, Unitary operation on MPS...)
And the `MPSSample.ipynd` is the main example page for it.
